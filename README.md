# sentiment_analysis

The primary goal of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately classify the sentiment of text data.  
This provides valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and social media trends.

## Key Concepts and Challenges
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Process and understand human language.  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Implement SVM, Naive Bayes, or deep learning models.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from text data.  
- **Data Visualization:** Present sentiment results clearly with charts.  

## Learning Objectives
- Understand NLP fundamentals.  
- Gain experience in text classification.  
- Learn to evaluate ML models for sentiment analysis.  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit‑learn, NLTK, SpaCy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook 
3. Run cells sequentially to reproduce results.
